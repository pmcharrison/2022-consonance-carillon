# syntax = docker/dockerfile:1.2
#
# Note - the syntax of this Dockerfile differs in several ways from the sample Dockerfile
# provided in the Dallinger documentation.
#
# - We do not use constraints.txt because generating this file requires a local pip-compile installation
#   which goes against the no-installation philosophy. Instead of constraints.txt providing the defininitive
#   account of the installed packages, this responsibility now falls to the built Docker image.
# - We install the full requirements.txt rather than filtering out packages that are already present in the base image.
#   This simplifies the logic and ensures that experimenters can specify package versions precisely if they want.
#   The small performance overhead is mostly eliminated by caching.
